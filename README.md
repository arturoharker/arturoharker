- 👋 Hi, I’m Arturo Harker (@arturoharker), Asssociate Professor at the School of Government, Universidad de los Andes. I am Faculty Affiliate of the Care and Protection of Children (CPC) Learning Network.
- 👀 I’m interested in applied microeconomics and quantitative public policy evaluation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying the impact of adverse childhood experiences –such as exposure to violence, forced displacement and extreme poverty– on the development of cognitive, social and emotional abilities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects that focuse on the design and evaluation of interventions that help mitigate this impact. 
- 📫 Reach me at: a.harker@uniandes.edu.co
